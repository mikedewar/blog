Hi, I'm Michael Dewar. I make products by creating and combining algorithms, often using algorithms that learn from data.

I'd like to develop a practice around building products "using" algorithms. In the [Posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}}) section you'll find some thoughts about that. Here's the [RSS](/posts/index.xml).

My code goes on [Github](https://github.com/mikedewar).

I work at Mastercard in the [Financial Crime Solutions](https://www.vocalink.com/services/financial-crime-solutions/) team, where I lead the data science efforts.
