Designing with algorithms is a strange, distant activity. We build products by writing recipes of nearly-text that describe how something elsewhere should happen at some later date. Like any text we’re not going to be there when our algorithms are “read”. But unlike other text it’s not the algorithm - the thing we wrote - that’s read, it’s the algorithm’s output that’s experienced as a product. When we design with algorithms we are twice removed from the artifact we’re designing; the text we write isn’t read, and the experience happens without us.   

Some algorithms completely contain the resulting design, like Sol Lewitt’s “Wall Drawings” or Rosenkrantz & Louis-Rosenberg’s generative jewelry. In these designs the algorithm is captured as a set of instructions that, when executed by a gallery intern or a 3D printer, result in artifacts whose properties were already in the algorithm as written. The designs become concrete when executed. They are unconcerned with the outside world, and we take small pleasures in the aesthetics when it intrudes - the shadows and light in the gallery or the texture of the printed ceramics. 

Some algorithms can be thought of as transformations where data flows through the algorithm, changing states as it flows. A multi-user word processor for example uses an algorithm to synchronise a single document as multiple people edit it. Contributed textual data flows through the algorithm and back out again into the eyes’ of the writers in the form of a shared image on a screen. The algorithm’s design is such that the people engaged with it are unaware of its execution; the algorithm’s designers carefully sacrifice moments of textual consistency to achieve a pleasurable collaborative writing experience. 

Some algorithms incorporate data into themselves: information gathered from outside the machine used to affect the operation of the machine. The lovely design of Spotify’s Daily Mixes, presumably synthesising listening data from millions of devices via some clustering algorithm into a set of personalised playlists day after day after day. 

In all these cases the algorithms are rarely read by the people experiencing the design. As in all the other layers of a technical product, the algorithm is often too complex to be understood, not unlike the processors that execute it, the circuitry that powers it, or the logistics that assemble it. Having said that, as designers who use algorithms to build products, we are often in the position of being the final layer of complexity in the too-complicated stack, perched on top of a huge assemblage of machines and lower-level algorithms
